# Goal

The World Bank provides the Global Economic Monitor (GEM) dataset. Existing visualizations for the GEM dataset can be found at
the following link: [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-economic-monitor-(gem)](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-economic-monitor-(gem)).

The world bank also provides a governance indicators scores : [https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators/interactive-data-access]()

Similarly, another dataset exists called the Global Emerging Markets (GEMs) Risk Database. However, visualizations for this emerging market risk dataset are not currently available.

Our tool is designed to combine the three datasets and harness the power of knowledge graphs to facilitate visualization, and answer complex analytical questions.
